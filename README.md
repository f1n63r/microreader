Very simple web based RSS/Atom reader, written in python and bottle. 

Try it out by installing requirements `pip install requirements.txt` and 
run `python microreader.py` . Then access http://localhost:3000

A JSON api is also available for most url:s, by adding 'application/json' 
to the Accept header.
